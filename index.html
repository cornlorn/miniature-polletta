                        <h2>Our Journey</h2>
                        <p>This whole journey kicked off back in May 2020, right smack in the middle of the pandemic chaos. We first crossed paths on a language app, and after a few months of chatting, we decided to dive into the long-distance relationship game on October 20th, 2020. Three years down the road, and we're still standing strong despite facing a truckload of problems.</p>
                        <p>So, here we are on January 1st, 2024, feeling pretty darn prepared to take things up a notch. We've battled through our fair share of ups and downs, and we're not throwing in the towel. It's time to get real about this relationship, to make it official and serious, to confront our issues head-on, and to sketch out a future that's all about us for the long haul.</p>
